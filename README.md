**A silly micro-app to teach myself some [FRP](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) using [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) & the [SAM Pattern](http://sam.js.org/).**

* Keybindings: just start typing! ESC to retry, Ctrl+Enter or F2 to edit text.

## Installation

> Part of the _original_ experiment was to cover setting up a project with Typescript, ES6 and SystemJS. The latter has then been replaced with good ol' Webpack, greatly simplifying installation.

Simply run `yarn start` (if using npm: `npm install; npm run start`).
